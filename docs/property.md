# The Property class in launchpy

The launchpy property class helds most of the methods that are being display in the Launch API documentation ().\
The name of the class and instanciation method implies that these methods works on one property at a time.\
You can have several insances of property to apply changes to multiple properties.\
As usual more information can be found here : [datanalyst.info website](https://www.datanalyst.info/category/python/launch-api/?camp=referral~github~launchpy-doc)

The class is divided 4 types of methods:

* get methods
* create methods
* delete methods
* update methods

Here are shortlinks to the different methods explanation.

- [Get methods](#get-methods)
- [Create methods](#create-methods)
- [Delete methods](#delete-methods)
- [Update methods](#update-methods)
- [Helper methods](#helper-methods)

## Get methods

When you have your property instance created, the methods that you may want to call first are the get methods. They never take any argument, they donâ€™t actually need any argument.
The only thing important to know is that you must run the getRules() method before the getRuleComponents() method.

The different get methods are the following :

* **getRessource** : Enable you to request a specific resource from Launch API via GET method.\
  Arguments:
  * res_url : REQUIRED : Resource URL to request
  * params : OPTIONAL : If you want to pass any parameter.

* **getEnvironments** : Retrieve the environment sets for this property

* **getHost** : Retrieve the hosts sets for this property

* **getExtensions** : retrieve the different information from url retrieve in the properties

* **getProfile** : Returns the information about a profile

* **getRules** : Return the list of the rules data.\
    On top, it fills the ruleComponents attribute with a dictionnary based on rule id and their rule name and the ruleComponent of each.

* **getRule** : Update the rule based on elements passed in attr_dict.\
  arguments: 
  * rule_id : REQUIRED : Rule ID
  * attr_dict : REQUIRED : dictionary that will be passed to Launch for update
  documentation : https://developer.adobelaunch.com/api/reference/1.0/rules/update/

* **getRuleComponents** : Returns a list of all the ruleComponents gathered in the ruleComponents attributes.
  You must have retrieved the rules before using this method (getRules()), otherwise, the method will also realize it and it will take longer, without saving the rules.\
  It will also enrich the RuleCompoment JSON data with the rule_name attached to it.\
  Possible kwargs:
  * rule_ids : list of rule ids to be used in order to retrieve ruleComponents
  * rule_names : list of rule names to be used in order to retrieve ruleComponents

* **getRuleComponent** : Return a ruleComponent information\
  Argument:
  * rc_id : REQUIRED : Rule Component ID

* **getDataElements** : Retrieve data elements of that property. Returns a list.

* **getDataElement** : Retrieve a specific data elements based on its ID.\
  Argument:
  * dataElementId : REQUIRED : a Data Element ID

* **getLibraries** : Retrieve libraries of the property.\
  Returns a list.\
  Arguments: 
  * state : OPTIONAL : state of the library.
    Possible values:
        - development
        - submitted
        - approved
        - rejected
        - published
  possible kwargs: 
    - published_at : it will be greater that this date ('2022-12-12T10:19:20.867Z')
    - name : it will be matching the name as equals
    - created_at : it will be greater that this date ('2022-12-12T10:19:20.867Z')
    - updated_at : it will be greater that this date ('2022-12-12T10:19:20.867Z')

* **getNotes** : Retrieve the note associated with the object pass to the method. Returns list.
  Arguments:
  * data: OPTIONAL : object that is associated with a Note (rule, data element, etc...)

* **getRuleRevision** : Retrieve the revisions of the specified Rule.
  Argument:
  * rule_id : REQUIRED : Rule ID

* **getRevisions** : Get the revisions of an element.
  Arguments:
  * element : REQUIRED : the element definition dictionary


## Create methods

The same way than you can get the elements, you can create different elements.\
You can create only one element at a time.\
The different elements that can be created :

    (can be found from translator)
  * settings : OPTIONAL : settings for that rule component\
  possible kwargs:
